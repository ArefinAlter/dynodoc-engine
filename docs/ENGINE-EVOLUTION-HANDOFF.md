# Engine evolution handoff

Updated 10 October 2026. **Part 2a implemented and locally verified; publication/CI pending.** Part 1 remains published. Read [PRODUCT-SPEC](PRODUCT-SPEC.md),
[ENGINE-EVOLUTION-PLAN](ENGINE-EVOLUTION-PLAN.md) and
[SHARED-CHECKPOINTS](SHARED-CHECKPOINTS.md) before continuing.

## Part 2a: shared checkpoint foundation

- Versioned/domain-separated canonical objects cover all `DocumentState` fields,
  including tombstones, comment order, suggestions and removed choices. Logical IDs
  remain separate from addresses. Fixed hash vectors pin the Rust byte codec.
- Stable-key radix maps share unchanged objects across checkpoints and avoid fixed
  array chunk boundaries shifting on insertion. A one-node edit rewrites its value,
  map path and root; creation still scans/hashes the complete state.
- Document-scoped memory and PostgreSQL stores; no cross-document reuse or public
  hash lookup. Migration 0025 adds immutable bytes and checkpoint manifests without
  changing applied migrations or event encodings.
- Transactional opt-in publication derives an exact historical state, verifies full
  graph reconstruction before publishing, rejects mismatches, rolls back failures
  and supports same-revision concurrent retries. Reads reject missing/corrupt roots
  and check their recorded chain position. They still trust the root/history
  association; external attestations are not implemented.
- Operator `shared-snapshot` CLI; audited erasure removes manifests/objects and the
  admin preview/receipt records their counts and bytes. Ordinary snapshots and
  draft/version bases still use full JSON. No production default is switched.

## Verification and measurement

Seven codec/property tests and five isolated database tests cover round trips,
canonical bytes, all state components, reuse/insertion, malformed references/routes,
limits, legacy equivalence, rollback/retry, concurrency, scope and erasure. The
existing admin API erasure test also checks new counts and cleanup.

The first full application run failed the existing 100 ms SSE timing assertion
while a release build was running concurrently. That test was not weakened; the
full suite then passed all **216 tests** without competing work. Application fmt,
Clippy and unchanged generated OpenAPI passed. Standalone task lint and all 216
tests also passed. Standalone task docs passed with existing Rustdoc link warnings
in unchanged files. Standalone generated OpenAPI is also unchanged, including MIT
metadata. Remote CI is pending the source push.

Synthetic release benchmark: 8,000 blocks, 21 checkpoints (20 one-block edits),
135,244,119 bytes as repeated full-state JSON versus 7,831,404 unique object bytes;
4,727-7,284 additional bytes per edit. Initial write 163.55 ms, median full scan/write
168.54 ms, final reconstruction 115.87 ms, observed process peak working set
54.5 MiB. Read the codec document for method and limitations: no PostgreSQL/WAL,
large native files, transfer, concurrency or production backend acceptance.

## Next concrete task: part 2b adoption and bounded content

1. Add a compatibility-preserving default reader/writer selection between legacy
   and shared checkpoints. Compare legacy/shared-plus-tail reconstruction at every
   revision. Migrate draft bases/named versions by explicit versioned references;
   preserve historical readers, erasure and stale-base checks. Do not silently
   delete full snapshots or switch production before rollout evidence.
2. Introduce bounded typed text/format/asset chunks so a single large logical node
   does not exceed the current 1 MiB object cap. Benchmark PostgreSQL/index/TOAST/WAL
   and durable local/remote backends, streaming, cancellation and memory. The memory
   store is a test backend; write/read budgets do not bound the prior materializer.
3. Settle cross-language numeric canonicalization and a separate commit envelope
   binding repository, parents, root, operations/capture capabilities and actor
   evidence. Then implement durable local commits, resumable missing-object exchange
   and atomic branch refs (part 3). Offline convergence/audit/native host acceptance
   remain separate explicit gates, not consequences of checkpoint deduplication.

Current limits: whole-state residency/scans, up to 1 MiB per object, 512 MiB/one
million object operations by default, Rust-specific numeric encoding, no chunked
assets, no GC, no default-path storage savings yet. No complete product or capacity
claim. The radix tree is an implementation choice; comparative prolly-tree results
remain unmeasured. Backup retention still applies after live audited erasure.

## Source, deployment and temporary resources

Working from application `1907eea` and standalone `6e7fdf9`. Both copies must match
for changed Rust sources/tests/examples and migration 0025, while preserving engine
MIT metadata and its standalone rich-text fixture. Application implementation:
`7a8e28ed1bfdf5828deb341fdf9b533fad9f5469` (pushed). Engine commit/CI pending.

No VPS deployment; last recorded production remains `8c7461d`, schema 24, with the
previous Nginx header fix. The owned disposable PostgreSQL container
`dynodoc-evolution-part2a-20261010` and its volumes were removed after verification
and ownership-label checks. No test API/web servers were started. Existing local
services were left running. Temporary logs and synthetic benchmark JSON are under
the system temp directory.

## Earlier completed increment: part 1

The following is retained as the dated Part 1 release record. Its "next task" and
shared-storage limits predate Part 2a; use the continuation above for current work.

## Part 1 completed

- Made existing-editor document repositories the authoritative product. Replaced the
  duplicated combined volume with a current guide and marked legacy questionnaire/
  civic stages as historical. Corrected mathematical independence, complexity,
  shared-storage and audit claims, including their repeated cross-references.
- Defined stable logical identity separately from content addresses and formatting
  runs; initial graphs contain content, while the target avoids redundant full-file
  versions. Defined explicit offline/merge/trust/capacity acceptance boundaries.
- Added core `read_state_at`: nearest checkpoint at/before the exact revision,
  streamed suffix, revision/gap rejection and checkpoint/replay-count evidence.
  Historical batches/draft creation use the same reader as review/provenance.
- Streamed chain verification and made cadence checks query only sequence metadata.
- Bounded browser Myers extra work to input key count plus 1,000,000 work steps and
  trace to 1,000,000 integer cells (about 4 MB, excluding frontier/objects/input).
  Removed repeated frontier copies and quadratic duplicate occurrence lists.
  Exhaustion uses unique anchors/LIS; fewer matches can require additional review.
- Added exact historical replay/checkpoint/scope tests, duplicate-heavy matching
  regressions and uniqueness/crossed-move counterexamples to disjoint-ID independence.
- Synchronized the seven changed engine source/test files byte-for-byte to the MIT
  repo and preserved its packaging metadata. No event/schema/migration changes.

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Application `cargo test --workspace`, isolated PostgreSQL | 204 passed. After final streaming/cadence changes, all 13 event/snapshot tests passed again. |
| Application Rust formatting/Clippy | Passed, including all targets after final changes. |
| Frontend full unit suite | 274 passed, including document/spreadsheet/presentation import regressions. |
| Changed frontend files: Prettier/ESLint; complete Svelte/type check | Passed; zero Svelte errors/warnings. |
| Standalone engine `task lint`, `task test` | Passed; all 204 tests, including the unchanged 100 ms SSE check. |
| Standalone `task docs` | Passed with previously documented Rustdoc link warnings. |
| Standalone `task openapi` and generated diff | Passed; HTTP schema unchanged. |
| New documentation links, source equality and whitespace checks | Passed. |
| Application remote CI | Rust passed; frontend lint/build, 274 unit tests, 62 signed-in browser tests, 16 public browser tests and proxy regression passed. |
| Engine implementation and final documentation-head CI | Both passed. |

The isolated container `dynodoc-evolution-part1-20261010` and its volumes were removed.
No test servers started; unrelated local containers retained. No VPS deployment,
real native-host acceptance or marketplace publication was performed. Last recorded
production remains app `8c7461d`, schema 24, plus the Nginx repair. Local tests do not
establish hundreds-of-MB or large-service capacity. Remote browser acceptance used an isolated CI stack; it does not certify native
Microsoft/Google installations, marketplace publication or a new VPS deployment.

## Measurements and complexity boundary

Pre-change audit (10 October) release medians: synthetic 8,000-block/6,030,116-byte
JSON parse 58.44 ms; classify 41.36 ms; format patch 0.256 ms; replay 0.099 ms; small
paragraph merge 0.032 ms; 8,000-block fingerprint 8.19 ms. These exclude native
conversion, network, database writes, rendering and concurrent load. They are a
baseline, not a fresh end-to-end benchmark of this increment.

Current reads still hydrate full state; checkpoints and draft bases still duplicate
full JSON. Missing historical checkpoints still require genesis replay. The periodic
threshold is best-effort, not a hard 500-event tail bound. Key matching budgets do
not cover all shape/cell candidate matching or key-byte comparison costs. Signed
heads, shared object storage and a complete local commit DAG remain unimplemented.

## Next concrete task: part 2 shared checkpoints

1. Specify typed/versioned canonical objects, logical identity versus hash address,
   commit manifests, ordering, chunk/reference limits and all committed state.
2. Implement a tenant-scoped object-store boundary and shared checkpoints alongside
   legacy snapshots; no rewriting event hashes or applied migrations.
3. Compare reconstruction with legacy replay at every fixture checkpoint. Verify
   unchanged objects are reused after a one-node edit, publication is recoverable,
   missing/corrupt objects fail explicitly and tenant/erasure boundaries are intact.
4. Measure unique-byte growth and peak memory. Then migrate full draft bases/named
   versions and develop local commits/object negotiation in part 3.

Bounded parsing/object contracts start now; full-load acceptance is part 7. Real-host
experiments may proceed alongside settled contracts. Do not resume Office web-editor
parity or the questionnaire/civic roadmap. Update this handoff and both project
status records at every increment and before context/token exhaustion.
